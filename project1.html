         <p>Artificial intelligence (AI) refers to the simulation of
         human intelligence in machines that are programmed to 
         think like humans and mimic their actions. The term may 
         also be applied to any machine that exhibits traits 
         associated with a human mind such as learning and problem-solving.
         The ideal characteristic of artificial intelligence is
         its ability to rationalize and take actions that have 
         the best chance of achieving a specific goal. A subset
         of artificial intelligence is machine learning (ML), 
         which refers to the concept that computer programs can
         automatically learn from and adapt to new data without
         being assisted by humans. Deep learning techniques enable
         this automatic learning through the absorption of huge 
         amounts of unstructured data such as text, images, or video.</p>
         <p>When most people hear the term artificial intelligence,
         the first thing they usually think of is robots. That's
         because big-budget films and novels weave stories about 
         human-like machines that wreak havoc on Earth. But nothing
         could be further from the truth.
         Artificial intelligence is based on the principle that human
         intelligence can be defined in a way that a machine can 
         easily mimic it and execute tasks, from the most simple
         to those that are even more complex. The goals of artificial
         intelligence include mimicking human cognitive activity.
         Researchers and developers in the field are making surprisingly 
         rapid strides in mimicking activities such as learning, reasoning,
         and perception, to the extent that these can be concretely defined.
         Some believe that innovators may soon be able to develop systems
         that exceed the capacity of humans to learn or reason out any 
         subject. But others remain skeptical because all cognitive 
         activity is laced with value judgments that are subject to human
         experience.</p><hr>
